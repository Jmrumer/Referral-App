A referral form for employees to prevent referrals made by word of mouth from being forgotten or messed up.

```
## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

  Fixes the navbar to the top of the page and gives it a background color and bottom border.

2.(.img)
  Shrinks the image to a usable size for the navbar.

## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The Javascript function I created is:

 2. $("#reset").click(function(event){
   alert("The form has been cleared.");
   });
   Gives an alert box when the form is cleared.
