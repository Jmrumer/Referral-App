## Description
```
A referral form for employees to prevent referrals made by word of mouth from being forgotten or messed up.

```
## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. ( .navbar )
  Fixes the navbar to the top of the page and gives it a background color and bottom border.

2.(.img)
  Shrinks the image to a usable size for the navbar.

3.(.formborder)
  Creates the yellow box that wraps the form elements.


```
## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The Javascript function I created is:

 1.  onRadioButtonChange();
  Evaluates which radio buttons are checked and changes the value of the action attribute in the form, this in turn changes the email to which the form is submitted.
