## Description
```
A referral form for employees to prevent referrals made by word of mouth from being forgotten or messed up.

```
## Custom CSS Classes
```
Some of the class(es) I created are:

1. ( .navbar )
  Fixes the navbar to the top of the page and gives it a background color and bottom border.

2.(.img)
  Shrinks the image to a usable size for the navbar.

3.(.formborder)
  Creates the yellow box that wraps the form elements.

4. (.box) Allows for easy flex box manipulation of the form elements


```
## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The Javascript function I created is:

 1. A set of anonymous functions that change the form action attribute based on which radio button is selected.
 2. $("#reset").click(function(event){
   alert("The form has been cleared.");
   });
   Gives an alert box when the form is cleared.
